# Steamworks Mainframe
Wrapper for [Steamworks.NET](https://github.com/rlabrecque/Steamworks.NET/tree/master). Inspired by [Facepunch](https://wiki.facepunch.com/steamworks/).

The reason for this is that the Facepunch library [doesn't work on Apple Silicon](https://github.com/Facepunch/Facepunch.Steamworks/issues/591). Steamworks.NET does, however, the API is more cumbersome to use. So I wanted to create a Facepunch-like experience using Steamworks.NET API.
